def generate_triangle_sequence(n):
    """
    Generate the first n numbers in a Triangle Number Sequence.

    A Triangle Number Sequence is a sequence where each number is the sum 
    of consecutive integers starting from 1. For example:
    1st triangle number: 1
    2nd triangle number: 1 + 2 = 3
    3rd triangle number: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
    4th triangle number: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

    Args:
        n (int): The number of triangle numbers to generate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of the first n triangle numbers.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative.
        TypeError: If n is not an integer.
